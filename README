A really quick validator for jQuery. For example:

  $('input.email').instavalidate(/^\w+@\w+\.\w+/);

Now add this to your stylesheet:

  .invalid {color: red}

And that's it. Your input will turn red when an invalid e-mail address is entered.
There are more options too; see the source for details.
